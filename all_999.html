   <p>
    On an 8 x 8 chessboard, there is one white rook.  There also may be empty squares, white
        bishops, and black pawns.  These are given as characters 'R', '.',
        'B', and 'p' respectively. Uppercase characters represent white pieces, and
        lowercase characters represent black pieces.
   </p>
   <p>
    The rook moves as in the rules of Chess: it chooses one of four cardinal directions (north,
        east, west, and south), then moves in that direction until it chooses to stop, reaches the
        edge of the board, or captures an opposite colored pawn by moving to the same square it
        occupies.  Also, rooks cannot move into the same square as other friendly bishops.
   </p>
   <p>
    Return the number of pawns the rook can capture in one move.
   </p>
   <p>
