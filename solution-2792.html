   <meta content="Leetcode 2792. Count Nodes That Are Great Enough Description You are given a root to a binary tree and an integer k. A node of this tree is called great enough if the followings hold: Its subtree has at least k nodes. Its value is greater than the value of at least k nodes in its subtree. Return the number of nodes in this tree that are great enough.
