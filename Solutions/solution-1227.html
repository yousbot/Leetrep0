   <meta content="Leetcode 1227. Airplane Seat Assignment Probability Description n passengers board an airplane with exactly n seats. The first passenger has lost the ticket and picks a seat randomly. But after that, the rest of the passengers will: Take their own seat if it is still available, and Pick other seats randomly when they find their seat occupied Return the probability that the nth person gets his own seat. &amp;nbsp; Example 1: Input: n = 1 Output: 1.00000 Explanation: The first person can only get the first seat. Example 2: Input: n = 2 Output: 0.50000 Explanation: The second person has a probability of 0.5 to get the second seat (when first person gets the first seat). &amp;nbsp; Constraints: 1 &amp;lt;= n &amp;lt;= 105 Solutions Solution 1: Mathematics Let $f(n)$ represent the probability that the $n$th passenger will sit in their own seat when there are $n$ passengers boarding. Consider from the simplest case: When $n=1$, there is only 1 passenger and 1 seat, so the first passenger can only sit in the first seat, $f(1)=1$; When $n=2$, there are 2 seats, each seat has a probability of 0.5 to be chosen by the first passenger. After the first passenger chooses a seat, the second passenger can only choose the remaining seat, so the second passenger has a probability of 0.5 to sit in their own seat, $f(2)=0.5$. When $n&amp;gt;2$, how to calculate the value of $f(n)$? Consider the seat chosen by the first passenger, there are three cases. The first passenger has a probability of $\frac{1}{n}$ to choose the first seat, then all passengers can sit in their own seats, so the probability of the $n$th passenger sitting in their own seat is 1.0. The first passenger has a probability of $\frac{1}{n}$ to choose the $n$th seat, then the second to the $(n-1)$th passengers can sit in their own seats, the $n$th passenger can only sit in the first seat, so the probability of the $n$th passenger sitting in their own seat is 0.0. The first passenger has a probability of $\frac{n-2}{n}$ to choose the remaining seats, each seat has a probability of $\frac{1}{n}$ to be chosen. Suppose the first passenger chooses the $i$th seat, where $2 \le i \le n-1$, then the second to the $(i-1)$th passengers can sit in their own seats, the seats of the $i$th to the $n$th passengers are uncertain, the $i$th passenger will randomly choose from the remaining $n-(i-1)=n-i+1$ seats (including the first seat and the $(i+1)$th to the $n$th seats). Since the number of remaining passengers and seats is $n-i+1$, and 1 passenger will randomly choose a seat, the problem size is reduced from $n$ to $n-i+1$. Combining the above three cases, we can get the recursive formula of $f(n)$: \[\begin{aligned} f(n) &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{n} \times 1.0 + \frac{1}{n} \times 0.0 + \frac{1}{n} \times \sum_{i=2}^{n-1} f(n-i+1) \\ &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{n}(1.0+\sum_{i=2}^{n-1} f(n-i+1)) \end{aligned}\] In the above recursive formula, there are $n-2$ values of $i$, since the number of values of $i$ must..." property="og:description"/>

      <p>
       Let $f(n)$ represent the probability that the $n$th passenger will sit in their own seat when there are $n$ passengers boarding. Consider from the simplest case:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         When $n=1$, there is only 1 passenger and 1 seat, so the first passenger can only sit in the first seat, $f(1)=1$;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When $n=2$, there are 2 seats, each seat has a probability of 0.5 to be chosen by the first passenger. After the first passenger chooses a seat, the second passenger can only choose the remaining seat, so the second passenger has a probability of 0.5 to sit in their own seat, $f(2)=0.5$.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       When $n&gt;2$, how to calculate the value of $f(n)$? Consider the seat chosen by the first passenger, there are three cases.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The first passenger has a probability of $\frac{1}{n}$ to choose the first seat, then all passengers can sit in their own seats, so the probability of the $n$th passenger sitting in their own seat is 1.0.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The first passenger has a probability of $\frac{1}{n}$ to choose the $n$th seat, then the second to the $(n-1)$th passengers can sit in their own seats, the $n$th passenger can only sit in the first seat, so the probability of the $n$th passenger sitting in their own seat is 0.0.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The first passenger has a probability of $\frac{n-2}{n}$ to choose the remaining seats, each seat has a probability of $\frac{1}{n}$ to be chosen.
Suppose the first passenger chooses the $i$th seat, where $2 \le i \le n-1$, then the second to the $(i-1)$th passengers can sit in their own seats, the seats of the $i$th to the $n$th passengers are uncertain, the $i$th passenger will randomly choose from the remaining $n-(i-1)=n-i+1$ seats (including the first seat and the $(i+1)$th to the $n$th seats). Since the number of remaining passengers and seats is $n-i+1$, and 1 passenger will randomly choose a seat, the problem size is reduced from $n$ to $n-i+1$.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Combining the above three cases, we can get the recursive formula of $f(n)$:
      </p>
      \[\begin{aligned}
f(n) &amp;= \frac{1}{n} \times 1.0 + \frac{1}{n} \times 0.0 + \frac{1}{n} \times \sum_{i=2}^{n-1} f(n-i+1) \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{n}(1.0+\sum_{i=2}^{n-1} f(n-i+1))
\end{aligned}\]
      <p>
       In the above recursive formula, there are $n-2$ values of $i$, since the number of values of $i$ must be a non-negative integer, so the above recursive formula only holds when $n-2 \ge 0$ i.e., $n \ge 2$.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you directly use the above recursive formula to calculate the value of $f(n)$, the time complexity is $O(n^2)$, which cannot pass all test cases, so it needs to be optimized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Replace $n$ with $n-1$ in the above recursive formula, you can get the recursive formula:
      </p>
      \[f(n-1) = \frac{1}{n-1}(1.0+\sum_{i=2}^{n-2} f(n-i))\]
      <p>
       In the above recursive formula, there are $n-3$ values of $i$, and the above recursive formula only holds when $n-3 \ge 0$ i.e., $n \ge 3$.
      </p>
      <p>
       When $n \ge 3$, the above two recursive formulas can be written as follows:
      </p>
      \[\begin{aligned}
n \times f(n) &amp;= 1.0+\sum_{i=2}^{n-1} f(n-i+1) \\
(n-1) \times f(n-1) &amp;= 1.0+\sum_{i=2}^{n-2} f(n-i)
\end{aligned}\]
      <p>
       Subtract the above two formulas:
      </p>
      \[\begin{aligned}
&amp;~~~~~ n \times f(n) - (n-1) \times f(n-1) \\
&amp;= (1.0+\sum_{i=2}^{n-1} f(n-i+1)) - (1.0+\sum_{i=2}^{n-2} f(n-i)) \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=2}^{n-1} f(n-i+1) - \sum_{i=2}^{n-2} f(n-i) \\
&amp;= f(2)+f(3)+...+f(n-1) - (f(2)+f(3)+...+f(n-2)) \\
&amp;= f(n-1)
\end{aligned}\]
      <p>
       After simplification, we get the simplified recursive formula:
      </p>
      \[\begin{aligned}
n \times f(n) &amp;= n \times f(n-1) \\
f(n) &amp;= f(n-1)
\end{aligned}\]
      <p>
       Since we know that $f(1)=1$ and $f(2)=0.5$, therefore when $n \ge 3$, according to $f(n) = f(n-1)$, we know that for any positive integer $n$, $f(n)=0.5$. And since $f(2)=0.5$, therefore when $n \ge 2$, for any positive integer $n$, $f(n)=0.5$.
      </p>
      <p>
       From this, we can get the result of $f(n)$:
      </p>
      \[f(n) = \begin{cases}
1.0, &amp; n = 1 \\
0.5, &amp; n \ge 2
\end{cases}\]
