1270. All People Report to the Given Manager

Description

Table: Employees


+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| manager_id    | int     |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with ID employee_id and name employee_name reports his work to his/her direct manager with manager_id
The head of the company is the employee with employee_id = 1.


&amp;nbsp;

Write a solution to find employee_id of all employees that directly or indirectly report their work to the head of the company.

The indirect relation between managers will not exceed three managers as the company is small.

Return the result table in any order.

The&amp;nbsp;result format is in the following example.

&amp;nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: 
Employees table:
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id |
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| 1           | Boss          | 1          |
| 3           | Alice         | 3          |
| 2           | Bob           | 1          |
| 4           | Daniel        | 2          |
| 7           | Luis          | 4          |
| 8           | Jhon          | 3          |
| 9           | Angela        | 8          |
| 77          | Robert        | 1          |
+-------------+---------------+------------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 2           |
| 77          |
| 4           |
| 7           |
+-------------+
Explanation: 
The head of the company is the employee with employee_id 1.
The employees with employee_id 2 and 77 report their work directly to the head of the company.
The employee with employee_id 4 reports their work indirectly to the head of the company 4 --&amp;gt; 2 --&amp;gt; 1. 
The employee with employee_id 7 reports their work indirectly to the head of the company 7 --&amp;gt; 4 --&amp;gt; 2 --&amp;gt; 1.
The employees with employee_id 3, 8, and 9 do not report their work to the head of the company directly or indirectly. 


Solutions

Solution 1: Two Joins

We can use two joins to find all employees who report directly or indirectly to the company CEO.

Specifically, we first use a join to find the manager_id of the superior manager for each manager_id, and then use another join to find the manager_id of the higher-level manager. Finally, if the manager_id of the higher-level manager is $1$ and the employee_id of the employee is not $1$, it means that the employee reports directly or indirectly to the company CEO.

# Write your MySQL query statement below

select a.employee_id as EMPLOYEE_ID
from
    Employees as a
    left join
    Employees as b on a.manager_id = b.employee_id
    left join
    Employees as c on b.manager_id = c.employee_id
    left join
    Employees as d on c.manager_id = d.employee_id
where
    a.employee_id != 1
    and
    d.employee_id = 1;

--

SELECT e1.employee_id
FROM
    Employees AS e1
    JOIN Employees AS e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id
    JOIN Employees AS e3 ON e2.manager_id = e3.employee_id
WHERE e1.employee_id != 1 AND e3.manager_id = 1;
