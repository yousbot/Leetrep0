       The election is conducted in a city where everyone can vote for
       <strong>
        one or more
       </strong>
       candidates or choose
       <strong>
        not

       <strong>

       so if they vote for multiple candidates, their vote gets equally split across them. For example, if a person votes for

      <p>
       Write a solution to find

       who got the most votes and won the election. Output the name of the

        Solution 1: Window Function + Group Statistics
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We can use the window function
       <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        count
       </code>
       to calculate the number of votes each voter gives to the candidates, then use the group statistics function
       <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        sum
       </code>
       to calculate the total number of votes for each candidate. Next, we use the window function
       <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        rank
       </code>
       to calculate the ranking of each candidate, and finally filter out the candidate who ranks first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that there may be multiple candidates ranking first in the result set, so we need to use
       <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        order by
