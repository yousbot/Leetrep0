   <meta content="Leetcode 853. Car Fleet Description There are n cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is target miles away. You are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the position of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car (in miles per hour). A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it&amp;nbsp;and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed. The faster car will slow down to match the slower car&amp;#39;s speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position). A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet. If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet. Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination. &amp;nbsp; Example 1: Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3] Output: 3 Explanation: The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12. The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself. The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target. Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3. Example 2: Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3] Output: 1 Explanation: There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet. Example 3: Input: target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1] Output: 1 Explanation: The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The fleet moves at speed 2. Then, the fleet (speed 2) and the car starting at 4 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6.
