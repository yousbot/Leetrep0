    There are two kinds of threads,
    <code>
     oxygen
    </code>
    and
    <code>
     hydrogen
    </code>
    . Your goal is
        to group these threads to form water molecules. There is a barrier where each thread
        has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen threads will
        be given
    <code>
     releaseHydrogen
    </code>
    and
    <code>
     releaseOxygen
    </code>
    methods
        respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the
        barrier in groups of three, and they must be able to immediately bond with each other to
        form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond
    <em>
     before
    </em>
    any other threads from the next molecule do.
   </p>
   <p>
    In other words:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it has
            to wait for two hydrogen threads.
    </li>
    <li>
     If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it has to
            wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    We don’t have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; that is, the threads
        do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is just that
        threads pass the barrier in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that
        bond and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two
        hydrogen threads.
   </p>
   <p>
    Write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these
        constraints.
