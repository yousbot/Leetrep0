   <p>
    There are
    <em>
     N
    </em>
    gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station
    <em>
     i
    </em>
    is
    <code>
     gas[i]
    </code>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs
    <code>
     cost[i]
    </code>
    of gas to travel
        from station
    <em>
     i
    </em>
    to its next station (
    <em>
     i
    </em>
    +1). You begin the journey with an
        empty tank at one of the gas stations.
   </p>
   <p>
    Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the
        clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Note:

   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
    </li>
    <li>
     Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
    </li>
    <li>
     Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Example 1:
    </strong>
   </p>
   <pre>
<strong>Input:</strong>
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

<strong>Output:</strong> 3

<strong>Explanation:
</strong>Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
</pre>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Example 2:
    </strong>
   </p>
   <pre>
<strong>Input:</strong>
gas  = [2,3,4]
cost = [3,4,3]

<strong>Output:</strong> -1

<strong>Explanation:
</strong>You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
