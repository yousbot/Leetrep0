    In a social group, there are
    <code>
     N
    </code>
    people, with unique integer ids from
    <code>
     0
    </code>
    to
    <code>
     N-1
    </code>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    We have a list of
    <code>
     logs
    </code>
    , where each
    <code>
     logs[i] = [timestamp, id_A,
        id_B]
    </code>
    contains a non-negative integer timestamp, and the ids of two different
        people.
   </p>
   <p>
    Each log represents the time in which two different people became friends.  Friendship
        is symmetric: if A is friends with B, then B is friends with A.
   </p>
   <p>
    Let's say that person A is acquainted with person B if A is friends with B, or A is a
        friend of someone acquainted with B.
   </p>
   <p>
    Return the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person.
        Return -1 if there is no such earliest time.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Example 1:
    </strong>
   </p>
   <pre>
<strong>Input: </strong>logs = <span id="example-input-1-1">[[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],[20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2],[20190322,4,5]]</span>, N = <span id="example-input-1-2">6</span>
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-1">20190301</span>
<strong>Explanation: </strong>
The first event occurs at timestamp = 20190101 and after 0 and 1 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3], [4], [5].
The second event occurs at timestamp = 20190104 and after 3 and 4 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3,4], [5].
The third event occurs at timestamp = 20190107 and after 2 and 3 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2,3,4], [5].
The fourth event occurs at timestamp = 20190211 and after 1 and 5 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1,5], [2,3,4].
The fifth event occurs at timestamp = 20190224 and as 2 and 4 are already friend anything happens.
The sixth event occurs at timestamp = 20190301 and after 0 and 3 become friends we have that all become friends.
