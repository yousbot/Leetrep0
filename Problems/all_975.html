    You are given an integer array
    <code>
     A
    </code>
    .  From some starting index, you can
        make a series of jumps.  The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called
    <em>
     odd numbered jumps
    </em>
    , and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called
    <em>
     even numbered jumps
    </em>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    You may from index
    <code>
     i
    </code>
    jump forward to index
    <code>
     <font face="monospace">
      j
     </font>
    </code>
    (with
    <code>
     i &lt; j
    </code>
    ) in the following
        way:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     During odd numbered jumps (ie. jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index
     <font face="monospace">
      j
     </font>
     such that
     <code>
      A[i] &lt;= A[j]
     </code>
     and
     <code>
      A[j]
     </code>
     is the smallest possible value.  If there are multiple such
            indexes
     <code>
      <font face="monospace">
       j
      </font>
     </code>
     , you can only jump to the
     <strong>
      smallest
     </strong>
     such index
     <code>
      <font face="monospace">
       j
      </font>
     </code>
     .
    </li>
    <li>
     During even numbered jumps (ie. jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index
     <font face="monospace">
      j
     </font>
     such that
     <code>
      A[i] &gt;= A[j]
     </code>
     and
     <code>
      A[j]
     </code>
     is the largest possible value.  If there are multiple such
            indexes
     <code>
      <font face="monospace">
       j
      </font>
     </code>
     , you can only jump to the
     <strong>
      smallest
     </strong>
     such index
     <code>
      <font face="monospace">
       j

     </code>
     .

     <code>
      <font face="monospace">
       i

      ,
     </code>
     there are no legal jumps.)

   <p>
    A starting index is
    <em>
     good
    </em>
    if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the
        array (index
    <code>
     A.length - 1
    </code>
    ) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more
        than once.)

    Return the number of good starting indexes.

     Example 1:

   <pre>
<strong>Input: </strong><span id="example-input-1-1">[10,13,12,14,15]</span>
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-1">2</span>
<strong>Explanation: </strong>
From starting index i = 0, we can jump to i = 2 (since A[2] is the smallest among A[1], A[2], A[3], A[4] that is greater or equal to A[0]), then we can't jump any more.
From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can jump to i = 3, then we can't jump any more.
From starting index i = 3, we can jump to i = 4, so we've reached the end.
From starting index i = 4, we've reached the end already.
In total, there are 2 different starting indexes (i = 3, i = 4) where we can reach the end with some number of jumps.

     <strong>
      Example 2:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <pre>
<strong>Input: </strong><span id="example-input-2-1">[2,3,1,1,4]</span>
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-2">3</span>
<strong>Explanation: </strong>
From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:

During our 1st jump (odd numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because A[1] is the smallest value in (A[1], A[2], A[3], A[4]) that is greater than or equal to A[0].

During our 2nd jump (even numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because A[2] is the largest value in (A[2], A[3], A[4]) that is less than or equal to A[1].  A[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3.

During our 3rd jump (odd numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because A[3] is the smallest value in (A[3], A[4]) that is greater than or equal to A[2].

We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.

In a similar manner, we can deduce that:
From starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.
From starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.
In total, there are 3 different starting indexes (i = 1, i = 3, i = 4) where we can reach the end with some number of jumps.

<strong>Explanation: </strong>
We can reach the end from starting indexes 1, 2, and 4.
