    In LeetCode Store, there are some kinds of items to sell. Each item has a price.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, there are some special offers, and a special offer consists of one or more
        different kinds of items with a sale price.
   </p>
   <p>
    You are given the each item's price, a set of special offers, and the number we need to buy
        for each item.

    <b>

    </b>
    certain items as
        given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers.

    Each special offer is represented in the form of an array, the last number represents the
        price you need to pay for this special offer, other numbers represents how many specific
        items you could get if you buy this offer.
