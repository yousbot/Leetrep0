      In a special ranking system, each voter gives a rank from highest to lowest to
            all teams participated in the competition.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ordering of teams is decided by who received the most position-one votes. If two
                or more teams tie in the first position, we consider the second position to resolve
                the conflict, if they tie again, we continue this process until the ties are
                resolved. If two or more teams are still tied after considering all positions, we
                rank them alphabetically based on their team letter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Given an array of strings
      <code>
       votes
      </code>
      which is the votes of all voters in the
                ranking systems. Sort all teams according to the ranking system described above.
     </p>
     <p>
      Return
      <em>
       a string of all teams
      </em>
      <strong>
       sorted
      </strong>
      by the ranking system.
     </p>
     <p>

       Example 1:
      </strong>
     </p>
     <pre><strong>Input:</strong> votes = ["ABC","ACB","ABC","ACB","ACB"]
<strong>Output:</strong> "ACB"
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Team A was ranked first place by 5 voters. No other team was voted as first place so team A is the first team.
Team B was ranked second by 2 voters and was ranked third by 3 voters.
Team C was ranked second by 3 voters and was ranked third by 2 voters.
As most of the voters ranked C second, team C is the second team and team B is the third.
</pre>
     <p>
      <strong>

<strong>Output:</strong> "ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK"
