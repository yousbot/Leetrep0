       <strong>
        same salary
       </strong>
       . The teams should follow these criteria:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Each team should consist of
        <strong>
         at least two
        </strong>
        employees.
       </li>
       <li>
        All the employees on a team should have the

        All the employees of the same salary should be assigned to the same team.

        If the salary of an employee is unique, we
        <strong>
         do not
        </strong>
        assign this employee to any team.
       </li>
       <li>
        A team's ID is assigned based on the
        <strong>
         rank of the team's salary
        </strong>
        relative to the other teams' salaries, where the team with the
        <strong>
         lowest

        salary has
        <code>
         team_id = 1
        </code>
        . Note that the salaries for employees not on a team are
        <strong>
         not included
        </strong>
        in this ranking.
       </li>

<strong>Input:</strong> 
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+--------+
| employee_id | name    | salary |
+-------------+---------+--------+
| 2           | Meir    | 3000   |
| 3           | Michael | 3000   |
| 7           | Addilyn | 7400   |

<strong>Output:</strong> 
+-------------+---------+--------+---------+
| employee_id | name    | salary | team_id |
+-------------+---------+--------+---------+
| 2           | Meir    | 3000   | 1       |

| 9           | Kannon  | 7400   | 2       |
+-------------+---------+--------+---------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
Meir (employee_id=2) and Michael (employee_id=3) are in the same team because they have the same salary of 3000.
Addilyn (employee_id=7) and Kannon (employee_id=9) are in the same team because they have the same salary of 7400.
Juan (employee_id=8) is not included in any team because their salary of 6100 is unique (i.e. no other employee has the same salary).
The team IDs are assigned as follows (based on salary ranking, lowest first):
- team_id=1: Meir and Michael, a salary of 3000
- team_id=2: Addilyn and Kannon, a salary of 7400
Juan's salary of 6100 is not included in the ranking because they are not on a team.
