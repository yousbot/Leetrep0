      You are playing a solitaire game with
      <strong>
       three piles
      </strong>
      of stones of sizes
      <code>
       a
      </code>
      ââââââ,
      <code>
       b
      </code>
      ,ââââââ and
      <code>
       c
      </code>
      ââââââ respectively. Each turn you choose two
      <strong>
       different non-empty
      </strong>
      piles, take one stone from each, and add
      <code>
       1
      </code>
      point to your score. The game stops when there are
      <strong>
       fewer than two non-empty
      </strong>
      piles (meaning there are no more available moves).
     </p>
     <p>
      Given three integers
      <code>
       a
      </code>
      âââââ,
      <code>
       b
      </code>
      ,âââââ and
      <code>
       c
      </code>
      âââââ, return
      <em>
       the
      </em>
      <strong>
       <em>
        maximum
       </em>
      </strong>
      <em>
       <strong>
        score
       </strong>
       you can get.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Example 1:
      </strong>
     </p>
     <pre><strong>Input:</strong> a = 2, b = 4, c = 6
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The starting state is (2, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 6 points.
</pre>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Example 2:
      </strong>
     </p>
     <pre><strong>Input:</strong> a = 4, b = 4, c = 6
<strong>Output:</strong> 7
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The starting state is (4, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
- Take from 1st and 2nd piles, state is now (3, 3, 6)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (2, 3, 5)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 3, 4)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 7 points.
</pre>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Example 3:
      </strong>
     </p>
     <pre><strong>Input:</strong> a = 1, b = 8, c = 8
<strong>Output:</strong> 8
<strong>Explanation:</strong> One optimal set of moves is to take from the 2nd and 3rd piles for 8 turns until they are empty.
After that, there are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends.
